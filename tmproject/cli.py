"""
Your CLI code goes here, here you should copy the first `S1_0_cli_command_example.py` script and paste it here, remove
the `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement and preserve the `main` function, which is a Click command.

Remember to import the main function from the `__main__.py` file, and call it here.

Also, remember you can create a tree of python submodules to organize your code, for example, you can create a
`commands` submodule to store all the commands of your CLI application, and then import them here. Or you can keep them
here and create something like a `utils.py` file to store useful functions and classes that are used repeatedly
by the commands.
